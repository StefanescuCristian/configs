redshift.sh:
- requires redshift, obviously
- you can change min/max_color and min/max_light to your liking.
- the commented-out “sed” line… is because I’m using a custom applications menu to launch this script from Xfce4’s panel. I’ll explain how to do it if someone asks.

darkpaper.sh:
- requires imagemagick for its “identify” tool that is used to get the pictures’ brightness.
- doesn’t work with filenames containing spaces.
- might loop forever if there is no adequate picture in your collection.
- you need to set “d” to your wallpapers’ directory.
- you can set “delay” to the time in seconds before a new picture is set.
- you can remove “-maxdepth 1” if you want to recursively scan your pictures’ directory.
- you might want to try changing “pic_brightness=$((mean+stddev))” to simply “pic_brightness=$mean” and see if that gives better results.
- the script also changes the brightness setting of xfce4-desktop if the picture is a bit too bright (but not if it is a bit too dark.)
